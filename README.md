# Info
This repository contains sample submissions for school assignments I complete. I do not use this repo as a direct submission method for school. This repo only represents submissions I choose to make public for whatever reason (such as conveniently sharing projects with friends).  

# Textbook
You can find a PDF of my textbook [here](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/c_how_to_program_with_an_introduction_to_c_global_edition_8th_edition.pdf). Although the file is hosted by KSU, please note that is not my institution.
